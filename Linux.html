        Windows and Mac
        We grew up using windows and most of us  are used to the windows work flow and are afraid to switch to anyting that doesnt work arround windows and its understandable 
        First and foremost if you have gone through the why linux page you have noticed that i use or linux users tend to use the word distro, Distro is IT vernacular for a Linux operating system (OS). It is a shortened version of the term distribution. The singular
        and the plural (distro vs distros) are often used synonymously. In the Linux world, there are hundreds of different flavors of distro. Examples Debian,Arch, Ubuntu and Red Hat etc. This is the main reason new users may find it difficult to get
        into Linux. Now lets get to guiding,we have broken down the level of users into 3,these levels are constructed by taking in persons interests technical skill and stability,however this does not mean these distros that are recommended for a certain
        group can not be used by the others in another group,all linux distros can perform any task another distro can perform . Level 001. this level containing users who are new to computers,students,individuals that want to just to do there work without
        hassle of the technical skills. This list is full of stable releases .stable releases do not get constantly updated ,they are stable and are hard to break,they use long term support (LTS) schedules to update the system example update every after
        10 months. Here are the best choices for this kind of users : Linux mint. Zorin OS. Elementary OS. Ubuntu. PopOs. Fedora.
